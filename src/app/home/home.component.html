      Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through
      forms: reactive and template-driven. Both capture user input events from
      the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to
      update, and provide a way to track changes.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      Reactive forms and template-driven forms process and manage form data
      differently. Each approach offers different advantages.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Reactive forms</span> provide direct,
      explicit access to the underlying forms object model. Compared to
      template-driven forms, they are more robust: they're more scalable,
      reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or
      you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use
      reactive forms.
    </h5>
    <h5>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Template-driven</span> forms rely on
      directives in the template to create and manipulate the underlying object
      model. They are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an
      email list signup form. They're easy to add to an app, but they don't
      scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements
      and logic that can be managed solely in the template, template-driven
      forms could be a good fit.
